CMatrix - show a scrolling 'Matrix' like screen in Linux (curses based)

Version 2.0:

To compile the program, type './configure && ./make'.

CMatrix by default operates in 'eye candy' mode.  It must be aborted with
control-c or 'q'.  If you wish for more of a 'screen saver' effect, you
must specify -s on the command line.  For usage, run 'cmatrix -h'.
