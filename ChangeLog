cmatrix 3.1xlah - 01/02/2026 - Xylia Allegretta:
	- Made libncursesw optional at compile-time.
	- Moved key polling to after drawing logic to ensure something
	  has always been drawn when a refresh occurs.
	- Changed getopt() logic to error out when invalid flags are passed.
	- Re-added -c, -l and -x options.
	- Added override order to -c, -l and -x options.
	- Added libncursesw support for -x.
	- Re-added -o and overhauled its internal logic to be more similar
	  to normal scrolling.
	- Altered new-style scrolling to use the range 0 <= i < LINES
	  instead of 1 <= i <= LINES.
		- This allows for the matrix to be slightly smaller, saving
	 	  memory.
		- This also makes its behavior more similar to old-style
		  scrolling, which makes switching possible.
	- Added 'o' as a toggle for old/new style scrolling.
	- Re-added information to many files that were previously blank,
	  like AUTHORS, NEWS, README, and this ChangeLog.
	- Replaced the god-awful (and inconsistent) space indentation
	  with tab-based indentation, which is much easier to navigate.
	- Added more comments to improve readability.
	- Condensed a ton of variables into one flags variable.
	- Simplified code logic of converting a colour string to a macro.
	- Added the macro MTX_BLANK to make it more clear
	  what the sentinel value -1 means.
	- Removed the unnecessary sentinel value -2.
	- Replaced the is_head bool with the sentinel value MTX_HEAD,
	  reducing the matrix from an array of structs to ints.
		- As a result, the last character of a column will change
		  even when the program is paused, or (if -a is enabled)
		  when an individual line isn't moving for a cycle. The
		  character replacing it when the column scrolls will also
		  be different, when before, it would stay the same. This
		  probably doesn't matter to anyone but myself, but it's
		  still worth pointing out.
	- Added a toggle for the -k option during execution with 'k'.
	- Replaced the 'r' enable key with a toggle.
	- Made toggles less case-sensitive when applicable.
	- Sped up execution of rand calls by not using ifs to
	  determine if 'prealloc' is set.
	- Increased speed of prealloc intro text.
	- Added -P option to determine number of preallocated ints.
	- Altered 'rainbow' mode to affect entire columns at a
	  time and change less often. This hurts my eyes significantly
	  less, and looks more interesting, I think.
	- Added support for DESTDIR and --prefix for font installations.
	- Updated directory locations for font installations.
	- Removed the 'L' toggle because it's far too easy to hit by
	  accident.
	- And definitely other minor changes that I'm forgetting about... :p

cmatrix 2.0 - 03/29/2019 - Abishek V Ashok:
	- Adds classical Japanese character support out of the box
	- New rainbow mode
	- New lambda mode
	- Adds support for cmake
	- Facilitates building without matrix fonts
	- Fixes various bugs
	- Adds additional support information to README.md
	- Fixes Travis CI bugs and adds new test cases

cmatrix 1.2a - 03/31/2002 - Chris Allegretta:
	- Eliminated MAXLINES and MAXCOLS variables, now uses malloc()
	  to allocate the necessary memory for the lines and cols.  Vars
	  matrix, spaces, length, updates all moved to global variables
	  as pointers.  New function var_init().  New malloc wrapper
	  nmalloc (taken from nano).
	- Added resize code, mostly taken from nano.  New configure.in checks
	  for resizeterm() and wresize().  New signal handler handle_sighup().
	- The -f option now forces the linux $TERM type ON instead of OFF, since
	  modern Linux systems seem to work fine without it.
	- Added config.sub and config.guess
	- Added cmatrix.spec.in file, based on nanos.spec.in file by
	  Brett <brett@bad-sports.com>.
	cmatrix-1.1b - 04/09/2000
	- Added support for consolechars command as well as setfont.  Changes
	  affect configure.in and cmatrix.c (main).
	- cmatrix.c:
	  main():
		- Changed optchr and keypress to ints.  Fixes endless loop
		  condition on Irix.
	  c_die():
		- New function, uses va_args to die with better info on the
		  screen.
	- configure.in:
	  - Rewrote tests for console and X window font directories.  Moved all
	    font searches to end of the file so error messages could be more
	    easily seen when running configure.
	- Makefile.am:
	  - Better information messages for installing X window fonts.

cmatrix-1.1a - 04/03/2000 - Chris Allegretta:
	- New autoconf support.  Probably a few things broken but it's a helluva
	  lot better than the previous Makefile stuff.
	- Updated email and web pages in documentation.
